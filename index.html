							<b>Christina Miller Research Fellow</b><br>
							
							<p>
							
							Cate is a theoretical and computational chemist with a PhD in experimental physical chemistry (Durham University, 2019). 
							She holds a Christina Miller Research Fellowship at the School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh.
							Her research combines <i>ab initio</i> electronic structure methods and semi-empirical models to calculate and rationalise the structure-property-charge relationship of organic molecules and understand photon and electron driven chemical physics. 						
							<!-- Here is an image that you can customize for this page -->
							<br><br>
							Her expertise ranges from frequency-, time- and angle-photoelectron imaging of anions, to developing theoretical/computational protocols to interpret experimental signatures of molecular anions, 
							to modelling the aromaticity of charged heterocycles. 
							Her work combining theory and experiment has significantly advanced understanding of the excited (metastable) states of molecular anions. She developed and benchmarked protocols to extract structural information from the 
							photoelectron angular distributions of anions. 
						<br>
							<br>

							More recently, CSA’s research has expanded to developing ab initio methods to calculate and rationalise ring-currents of complex organic compounds. 
								Combining her knowledge of molecular anions with fundamental physical organic theory, she has developed protocols for calculating the aromatic signatures of redox-active aromatic switches.

								<b>Development of methods and applications for photon- and electron-driven chemistry</b><br>
									<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/epdriven.png" style="width:400px; height:280px; object-fit: cover;"/>
							</span>
														Electron-driven processes are ubiquitous throughout the chemistry and biology. Electron attachment to a neutral species yields negativity charged systems, anions, that are generally destabilised.
								These states are often metastable resonances (i.e. coupled to the neutral+free electron continuum) and are susceptible to autodetachment of electrons. Despite the drive to detach the extra electron and reform
								the parent neutral + electron state, these metastable resonances are known to be important drivers of diverse reactions. 
								Understanding, and ultimately controlling, the interplay of autodetachment and electron-driven chemical reactions represents an open challenge to both the theory and experimental communities, and as such 
								the fascinating world of anions remains unchartered.
									<br>
								Our group is interested in modifiying existing electronic structure methods, and developing new non-Hermetian methods, that allow us to model the energetics and lifetimes of these elusive species. 
								Such methods have been recently demonstrated to model the lifetimes for the open-shell tetracene anion, in collaboration with the Garand group.

								<b>Modelling Aromaticity</b><br>
									<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/arom.png" style="width:400px; height:380px; object-fit: cover;"/>
							</span>
														Fundamental questions related to understanding and control of aromaticity have tormented theoreticians for decades, 
								with the magnetic criterion (ring current) widely accepted as the most rigorous, if not directly observable, diagnostic property. 
								It is understood that, when the delocalised electrons of an aromatic (4n+2 π) system are subjected to a magnetic field, a diatropic ring current is induced. Under the same influence, 
								an anti-aromatic system (defined by Hückel to be a system with 4n π electrons) exhibits a paratropic ring current. Thus, the calculation and visualisation of the induced current is a 
								direct theoretical assessment of aromaticity. Although many of ways of calculating magnetic response and delocalisation exist, the ipsocentric approach is unique in the fact that it gives 
								insight into the physical origin of the ring current. Specifically, the ipsocentric approach not only gives insight into global ring currents 
								but gives rise to a set of 'spectroscopic’ selection rules that govern the (anti)aromatic ring-current patterns. 
									<br>
									We have recently collaborated with the  <a href="https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/58708118/Group_of_Prof__Dr__Matthias_Wagner">Wagner group</a> (Goethe Universität, Frankfurt) to developed protocol for 
									calculating the aromatic signatures of synthetically realised redox-active aromatic switches.
